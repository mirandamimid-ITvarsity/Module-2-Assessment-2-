             <h3>THINK LIKE A MAN</h3>
                <p>Think Like a Man is a 2012 American romantic comedy film directed by
Tim Story, written by Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, and produced by Will Packer. It was based on 
Steve Harvey's 2009 book Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man. The film stars an ensemble cast, featuring Michael
Ealy, Jerry Ferrara, Meagan Good, Regina Hall, Kevin Hart, Terrence J, Taraji P. Henson, Romany Malco, and Gabrielle Union
The film was released on April 20, 2012 by Screen Gems.[2] It received mixed reviews from critics, who 
complimented the film's humor, its soundtrack and the performances of the cast (particularly those of Good,
Malco and Hart) but received criticism for it being a "standard romcom".[3] The film was a commercial success,
grossing $96.1 million against a $12 million budget. A direct sequel, Think Like a Man Too, was released on June 20, 
2014, with the original cast returning, to negative reviews from critics but become a moderate commercial success</p>
