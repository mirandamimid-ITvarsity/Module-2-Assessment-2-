             <h3>JUSTICE LEAGUE</h3>
                <p>Justice League is a 2017 American superhero film based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name. Produced by RatPac-Dune
                     Entertainment,[N 2] DC Films, Atlas Entertainment, and Cruel and Unusual Films and distributed by Warner Bros.
                      Pictures, it is the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and the follow-up to Batman v 
                      Superman: Dawn of Justice.Directed by Zack Snyder and written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon,
                       the film features an ensemble cast including Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller,
                        Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Ciar√°n Hinds. In the 
                        film, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg after Superman's death to save the
                         world from the catastrophic threat of Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons.
                    Warner Bros. began to develop a live-action Justice League film in 2007 with George Miller set to direct,
                     but the project was cancelled due to production delays and budgetary concerns. A Justice League film would 
                     re-enter development as part of Warner Bros' upcoming DC film slate in October 2014, with Snyder on board to
                      direct and Terrio attached to write the script. The film was initially titled Justice League Part One, with
                       a second film (under the name Justice League Part Two) intended to follow in 2019. However, the sequel was 
                       indefinitely delayed to accommodate the production of a standalone Batman film starring Affleck. Principal
                        photography took place from April to October 2016. After Snyder stepped down from the film following the
                         death of his daughter, Whedon was hired to oversee the remainder of post-production, including 
                    writing and directing additional scenes, as well as reshooting a large portion of the film, which changed 
                 many aspects of it; Snyder ultimately retained sole credit as director. With an estimated production budget
              of $300 million, Justice League is one of the most expensive films ever made.
                 Justice League premiered in Los Angeles on November 13, 2017, and was released
          in the United States on November 17, 2017. The film grossed over $657 million
             worldwide against a break-even point of $750 million, becoming a box office 
            disappointment and losing Warner Bros. Pictures an estimated $60 million.
             The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action 
             sequences and cast performances but criticized the plot, writing,
             pacing, villain, humor, computer-generated imagery and Whedon's 
             direction. Its tone was also met with a polarized reception, with
      some appreciating the lighter tone compared to previous DCEU films
              and others finding it inconsistent and unnatural. In the wake of its 
                release, fans began to push for the release of Snyder's original version of the film; Warner Bros.
                 decided to move forward with the project in February 2020. It was released as Zack Snyder's Justice 
                League on HBO Max on March 18, 2021.</p>
