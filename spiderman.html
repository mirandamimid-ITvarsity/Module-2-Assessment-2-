             <h3>SPIDERMAN</h3>
             <p>Spider-Man: Homecoming is a 2017 American superhero film
             based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia 
            Pictures and Marvel Studios, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is 
            the second Spider-Man film reboot and the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
            (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan
            Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. 
            Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow,
            Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei,
            and Robert Downey Jr. In Spider-Man: Homecoming, Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture.
            In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the character rights of Spider-Man, integrating 
            the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character and Watts
            was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's 
            title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. 
            Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued
            in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded 
            in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.
            Spider-Man: Homecoming premiered in Hollywood on June 28, 2017, and was released in the United States on July 7, 2017,
            as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Homecoming grossed over $880 million worldwide, becoming the second-most-successful
            Spider-Man film and the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2017. It received praise for the light tone and focus on Parker's 
            high school life, and the performances of Holland and Keaton. A sequel, Spider-Man: Far From Home, was released on July 2, 2019. 
            A third film, Spider-Man: No Way Home, is scheduled to be released on December 17, 2021.</p>
