             <h3>BLACK PANTHER</h3>
                <p>Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. 
                    Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 18th film 
                    in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay
                     with Joe Robert Cole, and it stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther alongside Michael B. Jordan,
                     Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett,
                     Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa is crowned king of Wakanda following his father
                    's death, but he is challenged by Killmonger who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies and begin a global revolution.
                    Wesley Snipes expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to
                     fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel 
                     characters and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January
                      2011. Black Panther was officially announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance
                       as the character in Captain America: Civil War (2016). Cole and Coogler had joined by then, with 
                       additional casting in May making Black Panther the first Marvel film with both a predominantly black 
                       cast and a black director. Principal photography took place from January to April 2017 at EUE/Screen
                        Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and Busan, South Korea.
                    Black Panther premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United
                     States on February 16, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. Critics praised its direction, screenplay,
                      acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, and Wright), costume design, production values, and 
                      soundtrack, although the CG effects received some criticism. Many critics considered it to be one 
                      of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations including  
                      the National Board of Review and American Film Institute naming it one of the top 10 films of 2018.
                       The film grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide and broke numerous box office records, including the
                        highest-grossing film by a black director. It became the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time,
                         the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. and Canada, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2018.
                    The film received numerous awards and nominations, with seven nominations at the 91st Academy Awards including Best Picture, with wins for Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. Black Panther is the first superhero film to receive a Best Picture nomination and the first MCU film to win an Academy Award. It also received three nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, two wins at the 25th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three wins at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards from twelve nominations, among others. A sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, with Coogler returning to write and direct, is scheduled for July 2022, while a television series set in Wakanda for Disney+ is also in development.</p>
