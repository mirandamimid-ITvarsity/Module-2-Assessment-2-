                 Dis-Chem started selling its own private label line of non-pharmaceutical products.
                 2003 Launch of the Loyalty Benefits Programme. 2005 First store opened in Cape Town and national store rollout followed.
                2006 The Saltzmans established the Dis-Chem Foundation, which supports charitable causes in South Africa.
                2008 Dis-Chem’s partner store concept whereby Dis-Chem acquires a majority stake in an independent pharmacy and converts it into a Dis-Chem store, was conceived. The concept,
                alongside opening of greenfield stores, accelerated the growth of Dis-Chem’s store footprint.
                 2013 Dis-Chem acquired controlling stake in CJ Distribution, together with a non-controlling interest in Pharmacy Development Academy and Evening Star,
                  which marked its entry into the wholesale business.
                 The online shopping platform was introduced.
                2016 Dis-Chem was voted the best pharmacy brand by Readers Digest South Africa.
                The first store was opened outside South Africa, in Windhoek, Namibia.  </P>
