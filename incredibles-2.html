             <h3>INCREDIBLES 2</h3>
                <p>Incredibles 2 is a 2018 American computer-animated superhero film produced by Pixar Animation
                 Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Written and directed by Brad Bird, it is the sequel to 
                 The Incredibles (2004) and the second full-length installment of the franchise. The story follows the
                Incredibles as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life,
                only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. Craig T. Nelson, Holly
                Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast
                include Huckleberry Milner, Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener and Jonathan Banks. Michael Giacchino returned to compose the score.
                Following the success of The Incredibles, Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films.
                 He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since 
                 the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.
                Incredibles 2 premiered in Los Angeles on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United 
                States on June 15, 2018 in Disney Digital 3D, Dolby Cinema, Real D 3D, IMAX, IMAX 3D, and 4DX formats
                .The film received largely positive reviews from critics, with pra.se for its animation, humor, writing,
                and musical score. The film made $182.7 million in its opening weekend, setting the record for best debut
                for an animated film, and has grossed over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing 
                film of 2018, the second-highest-grossing animated film, and the 15th-highest-grossing film of all time 
                during its theatrical run, along with being the highest-grossing Pixar film and the third to gross 
                $1 billion after Finding Dory and Toy Story 3. Incredibles 2 was named by the National Board of Review as 
                the Best Animated Film of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 76th Golden 
                Globe Awards and 91st Academy Awards, losing both to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.</p>
